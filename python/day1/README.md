# Day 1

## Part 1

### Time Complexity

- The list comprehension used to read the file into a list is O(n)
- The for loop used to sum calories is O(n)
- The sort function used is O(n log n)

Therefore the time complexity is O(n) + O(n) + O(n log n) = O(n log n)

## Part 2

### Time Complexity

O(n log n)
